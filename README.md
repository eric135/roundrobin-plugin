This plugin provides a semblance of round-robin scheduling for Jenkins tasks.
Currently, it can handle single-subtask multi-configuration projects.

This plugin is based on the [Least Load Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/leastload-plugin) for Jenkins.
Like that plugin, it is licensed under the MIT license.
